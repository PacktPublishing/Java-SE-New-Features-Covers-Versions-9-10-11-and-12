Java SE New Features: Covers Versions 9, 10, 11, and 12, published by Packt

# How to use these examples
The master branch represents the **initial state** of the code before modification shown in the videos.

The **final state** is in the [endstate branch](https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Java-SE-New-Features-Covers-Versions-9-10-11-and-12/tree/endstate). You can switch to that branch with `git checkout endstate`. 

Because Java 11 is the current long-term support release, code examples requiring **Java 12** are commented out and marked with an "Install and enable Java 12 to run this code!!" note.
