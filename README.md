## About the Video Course
Swift is a secure, fast, and interactive programming language. It combines powerful type inference and pattern matching with a modern, lightweight syntax, allowing complex ideas to be expressed in a clear and concise manner. You can start using the new Swift compiler and migrate at your own pace, taking advantage of its new features.

This course will provide you with an in-depth knowledge of some of the most sophisticated elements of Swift development, including protocol extensions, error-handling, design patterns, and concurrency, and guide you on how to use and apply them in your own projects. You'll see how even the most challenging design patterns and programming techniques can be used to write cleaner code and build more performant iOS and OS X applications.

By the end of this course, you'll have got the hang of effective design patterns and techniques, which means you'll soon be writing better iOS and OS X applications with a new level of composure and control.
